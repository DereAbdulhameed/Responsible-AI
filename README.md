# Responsible-AI
This repo contains different notebooks about different aspects of responsible AI

Machine Learning models may be knowingly and unknowingly biased, and this bias can come in at every point in the Machine Learning Cycle and hence, such bias must be mitigated. I will be focusing on the following:
1. Bias Mitigation during Model building and Selection
2. Bias Mitigation during Model training
3. Bias Mitigation during Post-Processing
4. Bias Mitigation for Models in Preduction
